The Monitoring Framework will alert the Elasticity Engine of OpenSAF upon workload change of the running Services. The alert will consist of the name of the affected Service Instance name and the workload status. The research problem is to collect low level trace from the cloud cluster running OpenSAF, process and analyze the trace to obtain numerical workload data and interpret the workload in terms of Service Instances to detect workload change in the Services.",
